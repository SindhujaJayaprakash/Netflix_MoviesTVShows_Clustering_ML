**Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering**



**Problem Statement:**

 The project focuses on clustering Netflix movies and TV shows based on various features like genre, rating, and duration. The goal is to use unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify similar content groups, which can help users discover content based on preferences.

**Business Use Cases:**

1.Personalized content recommendations for Netflix users based on clustering.

2.Identifying niche content categories to enhance Netflixâ€™s recommendation algorithm.

3.Understanding market trends and clustering content for better targeting of advertisements.

4.Assisting production houses in understanding content gaps and demand patterns.

**Approach:**

**Data Collection & Exploration:**

1.Load and inspect the dataset to understand its structure and contents.

2.Identify missing values, duplicate records, and inconsistencies.

3.Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize trends and distributions.

**Data Preprocessing:**

1.Handle missing values in key columns like director, cast, and country by using imputation strategies or removing irrelevant data.

2.Convert categorical data (type, rating, listed_in) into numerical format using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

3.Standardize numerical features such as duration and release_year to ensure uniform scaling.

4.Extract relevant features from text columns like listed_in and description using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization if necessary.

**Feature Engineering:**

1. Create new meaningful features, such as:
   Content age: current_year - release_year.
   Genre count: Number of genres associated with each content.
   
2.Transform categorical variables into numerical representations suitable for clustering algorithms.

**Clustering Model Selection:**

1.Choose appropriate clustering techniques such as:

K-Means Clustering: Suitable for numerical data; requires selecting the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score.
Hierarchical Clustering: Provides a tree-like structure to understand relationships between data points.
DBSCAN: A density-based approach that can help identify noise and anomalies.

2.Experiment with different numbers of clusters and evaluate their performance.

**Model Training & Optimization:**

1.Apply the chosen clustering algorithm and fine-tune hyperparameters.

2.Evaluate different distance metrics and linkage criteria (for hierarchical clustering).

3.Use dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE to visualize clusters in 2D or 3D.

**Visualization & Interpretation:**

1.Generate cluster plots to analyze content similarities.

2.Create heatmaps to show correlations between features and clusters.

3.Present insights derived from clusters, such as the most common genres per group or the distribution of content ratings.'

**Evaluation & Refinement:**

1.Use metrics such as Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and Inertia to validate clustering effectiveness.

2.Adjust features and preprocessing steps based on evaluation results.

3.Compare different clustering approaches to determine the best model for Netflix content categorization.

**Results:**

1.Successfully clustered Netflix movies and TV shows based on genre, rating, and other attributes.

2.Insights into content groupings, allowing for better recommendation strategies.

3.Visual representation of clusters to understand content distribution and similarity.
